# R Part 1 July 8

# Break out work:

## Break Out Group

#On your own, create a new R Project in a new directory. A directory is just a file folder. 
#I recommend doing this in a file folder on your computer rather than in Google Drive, as 
#sometimes working in Drive will give you repeated annoying warnings about access. Save this 
#somewhere that will make sense for you and name it something that will make sense later, 
#like LearningR. 




#Create a variable for a list of numbers 10 through 20, give it a name that makes sense to you, and find the median value. 



# Write the command for pulling in a csv file. 


#Go to Mentimeter and give a thumbs up when done.
