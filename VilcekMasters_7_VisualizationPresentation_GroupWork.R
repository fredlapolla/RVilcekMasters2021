## Session 7 Group work

#1. Try out using GGplot to make a scatter plot of A1C vs Glucose. Remember there will be two parts: where you assign the aes and then where you add a geom.


#2. Try making the same A1C vs Glucose scatter plot but add in a line estimating linear correlation

#3. Make a histogram of lead levels, experiment with updating the bin width. Make a boxplot of diabetes diagnosis vs glucose level.



#4. Try making an error bar for mean Glucose by diabetes diagnosis



#5. Explore the palettes on R color brewer. Try changing the color scale on a scatter plot of glucose vs. A1C




#6. Try adjusting the X and Y scales to be in increments of 50 for glucose, 2 for A1C in your scatter plot of A1C vs Glucose. Change the theme (background), update the X and Y labels to say "A1C level" and "Glucose level".
